#This is a simple YAML list of keyword values that you wish to exclude from keyword clouds.
#If you provide a string value then it will exclude any keyword that matches treating the string
#as a case-insensitive regular expression.
#E.g.
#- library
#will cause keywords 'library', 'Library administration', 'About the library building' all to be excluded.
#If you need more control you can provide an arbitrary Ruby regexp as an element of the list, using the following syntax
#E.g.
#- !ruby/regexp '/^Library/'
#This would exclude 'Library' and 'Library administration', but not 'library' or 'about the Library building'

#If you encounter any problems you may want to look up information about YAML, encoding strings in YAML, or encoding
#Ruby regexps in YAML as appropriate.

#Example list
#- Academic degrees
#- library
#- !ruby/regexp '/^Match this exactly$/'

# List of keyword strings and regular expressions to exclude
# from display in the keyword cloud.
